## Project Euler

From the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/about):

> 
    Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
    The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.)

For me, personally, it's a fun diversion from the more curriculum focused things I'm working on. As I'm currently learning Javascript, it's also an interesting way to utilize a new language. Since I've spent most of my programming time with Python, I'll be providing solutions in both languages just to stay familiar with it.
